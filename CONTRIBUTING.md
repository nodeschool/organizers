# nodeschool organizers

### what is nodeschool

We are a **100% volunteer run** international open source community. We always need more volunteers, and there are always things to do!

There are two main things that nodeschool does:

- build and maintain automated workshops that teach software + open source skills
- organize educational events around the world

Here are some of the tenets of the community:

- there is no top-down leadership structure. we have thousands of students, hundreds of chapter organizers, and a small group of central admins who keep the website running etc.
- chapters should experiment with new ways to engage their community, and share approaches with other chapters over time
- events should be affordable and should strive towards diversity and inclusiveness
- we are 100% open source and like to license things as open source/creative commons

### where does the name come from?

nodeschool started in the Node community, but has since expanded to be much more broad. For example, we used to only have Node related content but now have workshops on a much wider range of content such as JavaScript, GLSL (graphics shaders), Git and WebGL.

We are now active in many communities around the world. Each chapter is an individual node that shares content and approaches with other nodes in the graph, which is why we still use the word 'node' in our name even though we are not specific to Node.js/io.js anymore.

### ways to contribute

#### join a local chapter

See if there is a [chapter near you](http://nodeschool.io/chapters.html). Each chapter gets their own github repo, e.g. https://github.com/nodeschool/berlin. These repos usually serve at least two purposes (maybe more):

- host a chapter page on the `gh-pages` branch ([example](https://github.com/nodeschool/berlin/tree/gh-pages))
- provice a discussion board for the chapter using GitHub Issues ([example](https://github.com/nodeschool/berlin/issues))

There might be an issue for new or prospective members to introduce themselves, or there may be one that is an announcement/planning for the next event. You should click **Watch** on your chapters repo so that you get emails when new discussions happen.

If there is no local chapter, and you want to start one, [check out our guide](https://github.com/nodeschool/organizers/#how-to-start-a-new-nodeschool-chapter).

#### help answer questions/tech support

All of our workshops point people at this issue board when they get stuck:

https://github.com/nodeschool/discussions/issues

Questions we receive there range from beginner to advanced. You can click **Watch** on that repo to get emails in your inbox when new people ask questions. **This helps us out a lot!**. We get a ton of questions!

#### improve a workshop

Each workshop has it's own github repository. For example, on our [giant workshop list](http://nodeschool.io/index.html#workshoppers) if you click on 'javascripting' it takes you to the github repo: https://github.com/sethvincent/javascripting

In this case it's maintained by @sethvincent. You can check out the [open issues](https://github.com/sethvincent/javascripting/issues) for any workshop and try and find one to dive in and help on.

#### create a new workshop

If you have an idea for a new workshop, you can dive right in and [build a new one](http://nodeschool.io/building-workshops.html). If you want feedback on your idea, open an issue on the [organizers repo issue tracker](https://github.com/nodeschool/organizers/issues/)

#### improve documentation

If you come across something that is unclear, either in a workshop, on our website, or anywhere else that has content tracked by git, please **send pull requests**!

If you have never sent a pull request before, we have a workshop that teaches you how:

https://github.com/jlord/git-it

#### talk with other organizers

We have an [issue tracker specifically for organizers](https://github.com/nodeschool/organizers/issues). There are many more ways to contribute in there. 

#### hack the process!

These are just some ideas to get you started, but as long as you are respectful and courteous to other nodeschoolers there is no wrong way to contribute.

If you have an idea for a new format for a nodeschool chapter event, or a new format for a workshop, or any other ideas, do them and send a pull request (or open an issue for feedback if you are unsure).
